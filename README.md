# pip-imports (Your First CLI Tool to Consider) 

forget pip freeze and pip install which versions


# How Install 
allows remeber this native bash app pure and not require any depencises so it always easy as download the get-pip file located in user/bin folder and execute it in your system using command bash get-pip.sh or samailir on your OS
but here advanced approches as (it made to forget about devices used and os and python app and pip lists so all devices can install it or simple by download the sh file and run it in your terminal linux such as linux or gitbash or use 7z in windows it have .deb file)

### How To in GitBash windows
if u downloaded the get-pip.deb file in ~ dir for example the code to get the future updates of the package done by github this repo run this command in gitbash
```
"/c/Program Files/7-Zip/7z.exe" x get-pip/data.tar -o"get-pip"
```
```
cd ~/get-pip && \
git remote set-url origin https://github.com/MahmoudHegazi/get-pip && \
git fetch origin && \
git reset --hard origin/main && \
git pull origin main && \
cp get-pip.deb ~/
```
```
cd ~/get-pip && git remote set-url origin https://github.com/MahmoudHegazi/get-pip && git fetch origin && git reset --hard origin/main && git pull origin main && [ ! -f ~/get-pip.deb ] && cp ../get-pip.deb ~/```
```

Forget pip freeze or requirments.txt manual or different vms even 1kk vms python apps handled via get-pip command and use putty 
We can also call this get_required_imports. As the name suggests, it dynamically processes any specified Python file (not all files) to identify the required imports that need to be installed in your virtual environment but are not yet installed. It then generates a required_requirements.txt file.

An example of a competitor is pipreqs, which lacks the flexibility and dynamic capabilities of get_imports.

# How to Install get-pip.deb GitBASH
```bash cd ~/get-pip && git pull origin main && cp get-pip.deb ~/```
```cd ~/get-pip && git pull origin main && cp get-pip.deb ~/```
```cd ~/get-pip && git remote set-url origin https://github.com/MahmoudHegazi/get-pip && git pull origin main --allow-unrelated-histories && cp get-pip.deb ~/```

Since your build was successful, you now need to install the .deb package on your system.

Install Manually with dpkg
Download the .deb package from your GitHub Releases:

wget https://github.com/MahmoudHegazi/get-pip/releases/latest/download/get-pip.deb
Install it using dpkg:

sudo dpkg -i get-pip.deb
If there are missing dependencies, fix them with:

sudo apt-get install -f
Now, you can run get-pip from anywhere:


get-pip
Convert to apt install (Recommended)
To make it installable via apt, follow these steps:

Host the .deb on a Public Repository
Since you’re using GitHub Releases, you can use it as a source.

Create an APT Repository File


echo "deb [trusted=yes] https://github.com/MahmoudHegazi/get-pip/releases/latest/download/ ./" | sudo tee /etc/apt/sources.list.d/get-pip.list
Update APT Cache


sudo apt update
Install via APT

sudo apt install get-pip
This way, users can install get-pip just like any normal package!

Final Notes
Every time you release a new version, update the .deb file in GitHub Releases.
APT repositories usually require a Packages file. If needed, you can generate it with dpkg-scanpackages.
Would you like help automating the Packages file generation for full APT repo support? 🚀

You said:
but i use gitbash
ChatGPT said:
Since you are using Git Bash and not a full Debian-based Linux system, apt does not work. However, you can still install the package using dpkg in Git Bash. Here’s how:

Install get-pip.deb in Git Bash
Download the .deb package from your GitHub Release:


wget https://github.com/MahmoudHegazi/get-pip/releases/latest/download/get-pip.deb
Install it using dpkg in Git Bash:


dpkg -i get-pip.deb
If dpkg is not installed in Git Bash, you need to use MSYS2 or Windows Subsystem for Linux (WSL) to run this command.

If using WSL, open it and run:

sudo dpkg -i get-pip.deb
Run the script:


get-pip
Alternative: Run get-pip.sh Directly
If you don’t want to use .deb in Git Bash, you can directly run the script:

wget https://github.com/MahmoudHegazi/get-pip/raw/main/usr/local/bin/get-pip.sh
chmod +x get-pip.sh
./get-pip.sh
Would you like to fully automate installation for Git Bash users? 🚀

You said:
Option 1: Install wget in Git Bash
Open Git Bash and run:

pacman -S mingw-w64-ucrt-x86_64-wget
Once installed, try downloading again:

wget https://github.com/MahmoudHegazi/get-pip/releases/latest/download/get-pip.deb
Option 2: Use curl Instead
Git Bash includes curl by default, so you can use:


curl -L -o get-pip.deb https://github.com/MahmoudHegazi/get-pip/releases/latest/download/get-pip.deb
Next Steps: Install the .deb Package
Since Git Bash runs on Windows, dpkg won’t work unless you’re using WSL.
If you're on WSL, run:

sudo dpkg -i get-pip.deb
If you're only using Git Bash, you might need to extract the .deb manually instead. Let me know if you need that approach! 🚀

You said:
dpkg not found on gitbash
ChatGPT said:
Git Bash is designed for Windows and doesn't support .deb package installation because dpkg is a Linux tool.

Solution Options
1️⃣ If You Are Using WSL (Windows Subsystem for Linux)
If you have WSL (Ubuntu), open a WSL terminal and run:

sudo dpkg -i get-pip.deb
If dpkg is not found, install it first:

sudo apt update && sudo apt install -y dpkg
Then retry the installation.

2️⃣ If You Want to Use Windows (Without WSL)
Since .deb is a Linux package format, you cannot install it on Windows directly. Instead, try extracting the contents:

Install 7-Zip (if you don't have it) from here.
Right-click the .deb file → Select Extract to "get-pip/".
Navigate to the extracted folder, go inside usr/bin/ and manually copy get-pip to a directory in your system PATH (like C:\Windows\System32).
Run get-pip in Git Bash using:

bash get-pip
3️⃣ Rebuild a Windows-Compatible Version
If you need a .exe or .bat version, we can adjust the build process for Windows compatibility. Let me know if you want this! 🚀

Also this tool can help newbie/pro who doesn't have requirements.txt and wants to host their application on a new server.
