# pip-imports (Your First CLI Tool to Consider)

We can also call this get_required_imports. As the name suggests, it dynamically processes any specified Python file (not all files) to identify the required imports that need to be installed in your virtual environment but are not yet installed. It then generates a required_requirements.txt file.

An example of a competitor is pipreqs, which lacks the flexibility and dynamic capabilities of get_imports.

Also this tool can help newbie/pro who doesn't have requirements.txt and wants to host their application on a new server.
