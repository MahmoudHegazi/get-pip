Forget pip freeze or requirments.txt manual or different vms even 1kk vms python apps handled via get-pip command and use putty 
We can also call this get_required_imports. As the name suggests, it dynamically processes any specified Python file (not all files) to identify the required imports that need to be installed in your virtual environment but are not yet installed. It then generates a required_requirements.txt file.

An example of a competitor is pipreqs, which lacks the flexibility and dynamic capabilities of get_imports.
